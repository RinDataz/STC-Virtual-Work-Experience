# STC TV Customer Experience Enhancement

This repository contains code and documentation for a project aimed at enhancing the customer experience on stc TV through data analysis, predictive modeling, and recommendation systems.

## Project Overview

This project involves:

- **Statistical Analysis:** Conducting comprehensive statistical analysis to uncover key insights from user data.
- **Viewer Categorization:** Classifying and analyzing viewer categories based on program types (movies and series).
- **Viewing Patterns:** Investigating user viewing patterns to determine preferences for standard definition (SD) versus high definition (HD) quality.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Developing models to forecast customer views over the next two months, identify peak viewing periods, and pinpoint potential customers.
- **Recommendation System:** Building a system to suggest content based on the viewing habits of users with similar preferences, for both Arabic and English content.
- **Data Storytelling:** Preparing and delivering presentations showcasing analysis results and insights, offering actionable recommendations to improve service quality.
- **User Experience Enhancement:** Compiling findings into PowerPoint presentations to support further enhancement of the user experience.

[Task 1](https://github.com/RinDataz/STC_VirtualWorkExperience/blob/main/Copy_of_RinadHassan_stc_TV_T1.ipynb)

**Describe the statistical values for the given data set, including:**
  - *Arithmetic mean*
  - *Standard deviation*
  - *Maximum and minimum values*
**Classify and analyze viewer categories according to the program type (Program Class) - whether itâ€™s a movie or a series**
**Study the viewing patterns of users and identify the category that watches stc TV in standard definition (SD) quality versus the category that watches it in high definition (HD).**

[Task 2](https://github.com/RinDataz/STC_VirtualWorkExperience/blob/main/Copy_of_RinadHassan_stc_TV_T2.ipynb)

**Build an easy and simple model that allows the decision-makers to predict the number of expected customer views in the next two months, determine the expected peak period, and identify the potential customers.**

**Recommendation System**

## Important Note

- No output data is shared in this repository, as I do not own the data. Only the code I worked on is included.
